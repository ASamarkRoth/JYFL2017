<h1 id="lecture-notes---nuclear-astrophysics-and-the-r-process">Lecture notes - Nuclear Astrophysics and the r-process</h1>
<h2 id="lecture-1">Lecture 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Primordial = existing from the beginning of time</li>
<li>Volatile = liable to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse or easily evaporated at room temperature.</li>
<li>Solar burning : function(temperature, density).</li>
<li>Coulomb repulsion controls density.</li>
<li>There are s-only and r-only nuclei (slow and rapid), i.e. they are only created in the respective process.</li>
<li>Metallicity: [Fe/H]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-2">Lecture 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only fusion in core. Temperature and pressure gradient goes outwards.</li>
<li>Atmosphere of star = gas cloud that formed the star.<br />
</li>
<li>Black hole = center/bulge of galaxy. Most stars are found within a disk.</li>
<li>Look at stars = absorption spectra, i.e. only Z is relevant.</li>
<li>Ubiquitous = present, appearing or found everywhere.</li>
<li>Th-U ratio -&gt; age of stars</li>
<li>Actinide boost in stars.</li>
<li>Eu is easy to see.</li>
<li>Cosmological redshift = change of wavelength due to the expansion of the universe.</li>
<li>CMB - Cosmic Microwave Background</li>
<li>Black body spectrum = CMB</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-3">Lecture 3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Photodissociation - chemical compound is broken down by photons.</li>
<li>Nucleosynthesis network - Time dependent &quot;complete&quot; model.</li>
<li>Gamow peak = energy interval for which the reaction has optimal probability.</li>
<li>Baryon to photon ratio = eta. Important for big bang nucleosynthesis.</li>
<li>Hydrostatic equilibrium = pressure gradient balanced with the gravitational force.</li>
<li>Gamma rays from inner core of star scatter a lot due to dense matter.</li>
<li>Neutrino flavours are not in the standard model.</li>
<li>CP violation. This factor is the reason exp(-idelta) : it explains do nu and nubar couple differently?</li>
<li>Stars with larger mass have a larger pressure in the core due to gravitational equilibrium. This implies an increase in temperature.</li>
<li>Nuclear Saha equation : describes nuclear reactions in equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-4">Lecture 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Energy release contributes to pressure and resists a gravitational collapse.</li>
<li>Iron core collapse = supernova (shockwave)</li>
<li>Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons.</li>
<li>Electron to proton ratio &lt;-&gt; fraction of neutrons vs protons. Important to the neutrino wind, beyond core.</li>
<li>Higher entropy favours lighter nuclei.</li>
<li>Alpha elements = sum of alphas, e.g. C-12.</li>
<li>Neutrino driven wind follows shockwave</li>
<li>Energy of neutrino controls proton vs neutron richness</li>
<li>Electron degeneracy pressure = Electron degeneracy pressure is a particular manifestation of the more general phenomenon of quantum degeneracy pressure. The Pauli exclusion principle disallows two identical half-integer spin particles (electrons and all other fermions) from simultaneously occupying the same quantum state. The result is an emergent pressure against compression of matter into smaller volumes of space.</li>
<li>Gravitational radiation = energy of gravitational waves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-5">Lecture 5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Masses are somewhat known and have large effects of the mass abundance pattern.</li>
<li>Beta decay rates - we know a lot and can predict them well as well.</li>
<li>Neutron capture: no experimental data -&gt; only predictions. How good are these?</li>
<li>Fission for superheavy neutron rich nuclei impossible for experiments.</li>
<li>Fission recycling</li>
</ul>
