#Lecture notes - Nuclear Astrophysics and the r-process#

##Lecture 1##

* Primordial = existing from the beginning of time
* Volatile = liable to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse or easily evaporated at room temperature.
* Solar burning : function(temperature, density).
* Coulomb repulsion controls density.
* There are s-only and r-only nuclei (slow and rapid), i.e. they are only created in the respective process. 
* Metallicity: [Fe/H]

##Lecture 2##

* Only fusion in core. Temperature and pressure gradient goes outwards.
* Atmosphere of star = gas cloud that formed the star.  
* Black hole = center/bulge of galaxy. Most stars are found within a disk.
* Look at stars = absorption spectra, i.e. only Z is relevant.
* Ubiquitous = present, appearing or found everywhere.
* Th-U ratio -> age of stars
* Actinide boost in stars.
* Eu is easy to see.
* Cosmological redshift = change of wavelength due to the expansion of the universe.
* CMB - Cosmic Microwave Background
* Black body spectrum = CMB

##Lecture 3##

* Photodissociation - chemical compound is broken down by photons.
* Nucleosynthesis network - Time dependent "complete" model.
* Gamow peak = energy interval for which the reaction has optimal probability.
* Baryon to photon ratio = eta. Important for big bang nucleosynthesis.
* Hydrostatic equilibrium = pressure gradient balanced with the gravitational force.
* Gamma rays from inner core of star scatter a lot due to dense matter.
* Neutrino flavours are not in the standard model.
* CP violation. This factor is the reason exp(-idelta) : it explains do nu and nubar couple differently?
* Stars with larger mass have a larger pressure in the core due to gravitational equilibrium. This implies an increase in temperature.
* Nuclear Saha equation : describes nuclear reactions in equilibrium.

##Lecture 4##

* Energy release contributes to pressure and resists a gravitational collapse.
* Iron core collapse = supernova (shockwave)
* Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons.
* Electron to proton ratio <-> fraction of neutrons vs protons. Important to the neutrino wind, beyond core.
* Higher entropy favours lighter nuclei.
* Alpha elements = sum of alphas, e.g. C-12.
* Neutrino driven wind follows shockwave
* Energy of neutrino controls proton vs neutron richness
* Electron degeneracy pressure = Electron degeneracy pressure is a particular manifestation of the more general phenomenon of quantum degeneracy pressure. The Pauli exclusion principle disallows two identical half-integer spin particles (electrons and all other fermions) from simultaneously occupying the same quantum state. The result is an emergent pressure against compression of matter into smaller volumes of space.
* Gravitational radiation = energy of gravitational waves.

##Lecture 5##

* Masses are somewhat known and have large effects of the mass abundance pattern.
* Beta decay rates - we know a lot and can predict them well as well.
* Neutron capture: no experimental data -> only predictions. How good are these?
* Fission for superheavy neutron rich nuclei impossible for experiments.
* Fission recycling
