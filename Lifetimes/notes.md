#Lecture notes - Lifetimes to probe nuclear structure#

##Lecture 1##

* Electromagnetic operator
* Fermi's golden rule: Transition probability between two states.
* Why is rho(E_b = E_a), i.e. density of states? Unclear.
* Evolution of nuclear structure -> Which excitations are most probable
* Collectivity: measure is the number of nucleons involved
* lambda = 1/tau: tau = mean lifetime
* B(ML) = B(E2) = transition probability with a factor dependent of L in front.
* _Weisskopf units_: Normalise w.r.t. his estimates W.u. = e²b² = 10^-24 cm² = area, cf cross sections.
* Ballpark figures:
	
	* 1 W.u. = single particle transition
	* 10-100 = vibrational
	* 100-few hundreds = rotational

* Fast timing measure: time-stamp difference between gamma1 & gamma2. 
* CFDs still beats digital electronics.
* Scintillator: LaBr3 : Ce is the choice.
* A delay is added. This means that the real time difference is not measured. But Exp. Fit still works!
* _Prompt flash_: Too small time difference between photons for system to disentangle which came first. This occurs for prompt-coincidences. This can be seen as contamination if one desires to fit an exp. function.

##Lecture 2##

* Slope method and centroid shifts for lifetime determination. Choice of method: if one does not observe a clear exponential tail -> centroid shift method. 
* Prompt response function: time distribution that comes e.g. from Co-60. The function is energy dependent.
* Electronic measurements viable down to 10^-12 s.
* Recoil Distance Doppler Shift Method - Plunger device.
	* Stopper: odd-odd Au (not Coulomb excited -> no background)
	* Capacity measurements for length between target and stopper.
	* If desirable to perform measurements/separation of recoil: use degrader (only slows down)

##Lecture 3##

* _DSA_, Doppler Shift Attenuation

	* Reliable: Charged particle slowing down (well known) and essential for the analysis.
	* OBS: feeding might perturb.
	* A peak assumes a special energy distribution which depends on the lifetime of the transition.
	
* Q0 : quadrupole transition moment = different for prolate vs. oblate shapes.
* It is possible that the shape changes within a rotational band, such as the collectivity.

* _Coulomb excitation_: Measure matrix element directly (from Fermi's golden rule). Possible due to that the electromagnetic interaction is very well understood.
* Need to avoid reaction products created due to nuclear force interactions. This is ensured through careful choice of beam energy such that the Coulomb barrier is not penetrated.
* I.e. cross sections to excited levels are known -> look at intensities and resolve matrix elements. 
* Need to be aware that target nuclei are also excited.
* Matrix element can be split into two factors Q20 & Q22 -> need multiple measurements:
	
	* Different target material
	* Beam energy

* Typical energy ~ 3-4 Mev/nucleon.
* Cooperate with measured lifetimes -> more precise Q22.
* Ancillary = providing necessary support to the primary activities or operation of an organization, system, etc.
