<h1 id="lecture-notes---lifetimes-to-probe-nuclear-structure">Lecture notes - Lifetimes to probe nuclear structure</h1>
<h2 id="lecture-1">Lecture 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Electromagnetic operator</li>
<li>Fermi's golden rule: Transition probability between two states.</li>
<li>Why is rho(E_b = E_a), i.e. density of states? Unclear.</li>
<li>Evolution of nuclear structure -&gt; Which excitations are most probable</li>
<li>Collectivity: measure is the number of nucleons involved</li>
<li>lambda = 1/tau: tau = mean lifetime</li>
<li>B(ML) = B(E2) = transition probability with a factor dependent of L in front.</li>
<li><em>Weisskopf units</em>: Normalise w.r.t. his estimates W.u. = e²b² = 10^-24 cm² = area, cf cross sections.</li>
<li><p>Ballpark figures:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 W.u. = single particle transition</li>
<li>10-100 = vibrational</li>
<li>100-few hundreds = rotational</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fast timing measure: time-stamp difference between gamma1 &amp; gamma2.</li>
<li>CFDs still beats digital electronics.</li>
<li>Scintillator: LaBr3 : Ce is the choice.</li>
<li>A delay is added. This means that the real time difference is not measured. But Exp. Fit still works!</li>
<li><p><em>Prompt flash</em>: Too small time difference between photons for system to disentangle which came first. This occurs for prompt-coincidences. This can be seen as contamination if one desires to fit an exp. function.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-2">Lecture 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slope method and centroid shifts for lifetime determination. Choice of method: if one does not observe a clear exponential tail -&gt; centroid shift method.</li>
<li>Prompt response function: time distribution that comes e.g. from Co-60. The function is energy dependent.</li>
<li>Electronic measurements viable down to 10^-12 s.</li>
<li>Recoil Distance Doppler Shift Method - Plunger device.
<ul>
<li>Stopper: odd-odd Au (not Coulomb excited -&gt; no background)</li>
<li>Capacity measurements for length between target and stopper.</li>
<li>If desirable to perform measurements/separation of recoil: use degrader (only slows down)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lecture-3">Lecture 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><em>DSA</em>, Doppler Shift Attenuation</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliable: Charged particle slowing down (well known) and essential for the analysis.</li>
<li>OBS: feeding might perturb.</li>
<li>A peak assumes a special energy distribution which depends on the lifetime of the transition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q0 : quadrupole transition moment = different for prolate vs. oblate shapes.</li>
<li><p>It is possible that the shape changes within a rotational band, such as the collectivity.</p></li>
<li><em>Coulomb excitation</em>: Measure matrix element directly (from Fermi's golden rule). Possible due to that the electromagnetic interaction is very well understood.</li>
<li>Need to avoid reaction products created due to nuclear force interactions. This is ensured through careful choice of beam energy such that the Coulomb barrier is not penetrated.</li>
<li>I.e. cross sections to excited levels are known -&gt; look at intensities and resolve matrix elements.</li>
<li>Need to be aware that target nuclei are also excited.</li>
<li><p>Matrix element can be split into two factors Q20 &amp; Q22 -&gt; need multiple measurements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different target material</li>
<li>Beam energy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Typical energy ~ 3-4 Mev/nucleon.</li>
<li>Cooperate with measured lifetimes -&gt; more precise Q22.</li>
<li><p>Ancillary = providing necessary support to the primary activities or operation of an organization, system, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
